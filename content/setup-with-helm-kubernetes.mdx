# Setup with Helm (Kubernetes)

This Helm chart can be used to deploy LinkAce to your Kubernetes cluster. Please note that this chart deploys the full application stack by default, including a MariaDB database and Redis for caching. It is possible to use an existing database or Redis. Please see the values.yml file for details.

Note: This Helm Chart is currently a beta version. Please give feedback if you are using it.

## Helm Chart

Please visit the [**Helm Chart documentation**](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/tree/2.x/deploy) in the repository for the current version of the chart with usage instructions.

## Follow the post-installation steps
