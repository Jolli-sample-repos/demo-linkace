# System API Tokens

LinkAce has a comprehensive API which allows external applications to control content in LinkAce. Administrators can create advanced API tokens which are do not act like users, but the system itself. To make tokens more secure, you have to specify permissions for each token which cannot be changed later on.

> **⚠️ Danger:** Please store tokens in a safe place and treat it with extreme caution. Tokens may permanently delete content.

Once you created an API token, the token itself is displayed at the top. Please store it in a safe place. It is not possible to recover tokens if you lose them.
