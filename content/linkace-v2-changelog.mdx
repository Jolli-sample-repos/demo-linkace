### Support for multiple users

LinkAce now supports working with **multiple users**, which also includes a more advanced permission scheme as well as a new visibility setting for links, lists and tags ([#165](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/165))

* Administrators can now control various system settings and invite new users.
* Links, lists and tags can now be public, internal or private, which controls the visibility to the public as well as logged-in users.
* Links, lists and tags are now displayed with the actual author so it's clear who added it.
* Each user has its own API keys which can be used to work in the name of the user from third party applications. Additionally, admins can create system-wide API keys.
* Link checks are now run for each user individually. Users only get notifications about broken oder unavailable links they own.

Additionally, LinkAce now supports **Single Sign On** with OAuth or OIDC. 12 providers are already built-in, including one generic OIDC provider. Please consult the [dedicated SSO setup guide](https://www.linkace.org/docs/v2/configuration/sso-oauth-oidc/) for more details.

### User Interface

  + LinkAce now has three redesigned modes for displaying links: compact, detailed and as cards. This setting can be controlled directly from the interface, no settings are needed.
  + The main navigation bar was adjusted so users need fewer clicks.
  + Lists and tags are now loaded up-front when adding or editing links. This speeds up the process and allows near-instant searches.
* Links, lists and tags can now be bulk-edited. ([#26](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/26))
* Meta information was added for all relevant pages so your browser now displays more information. Contributed by chrissawyerfan4. ([#494](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/494))

* There is a dedicated CLI command to test the email configuration. ([#500](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/500))
* Importing & Exporting
  + The import process was overhauled for better processing of large import files. Importing of links is now done in the background. ([#287](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/287))
  + A unique tag is added to all links processed during an import, to identify them later on. ([#757](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues/757))
* Backups: you can now configure the hour when backups and cleaning tasks are started and disable any email notifications.
