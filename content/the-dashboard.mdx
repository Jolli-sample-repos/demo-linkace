# The Dashboard

After logging in, you will see the dashboard. It consists of several blocks that give you an overview of your links, and provide some shortcuts for adding links or searching for them.

## Table of Contents

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging into LinkAce. It display the last few saved links, a mini form for adding a new link quickly, as well as some numeric stats of your link database.

## Link Quick Adding

The top form allows you to quickly add a link with the default settings, without a distracting UI and without setting tags or categories. The link may be edited later on.

## Quick Search

The quick search allows you to search for links with a search term. By default, the URL, the title, and the description will be searched. The results will be displayed on the advanced search page, so you can refine your search quickly if you have to.

## Recent Links

On the left side of the dashboard you can find the five most recent links for quick access.

## Recent Lists

You can also find the most recently created lists on the dashboard.

## Recent Tags

The dashboard also shows the latest tags you added to your links.

## Your LinkAce Statistics

On the right side, statistics about your LinkAce setup will be shown. They include the number of links, lists, tags, notes and number of broken links. Broken links are those with a bad status: they are either unreachable or have been moved.
