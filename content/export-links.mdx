# Export

If you are not satisfied with LinkAce or want to store your links in your browser again, you can export all links to either a browser-compatible HTML file, or a CSV file readable by other applications like Excel.

**Exporting links with this feature is NOT intended to be a backup for LinkAce!** It does not store all information such as lists and some details about links itself! Instead, use [regular database backups](https://www.linkace.org/docs/v2/configuration/application-backups/).

Once you click one of the export buttons, LinkAce will generate an export file with all links in it. Please notice that this may take some time depending on the number of links you saved.

If you want to access your link data from other applications, you can also try the [**LinkAce API**](https://linkace.stoplight.io/docs/api-docs/). It's an easy to use REST API that can be accessed by almost any application.
