# User API Tokens

LinkAce has a comprehensive API which allows external applications to control content in LinkAce. With API tokens, users can authenticate from one of those external applications as themselves.

Once you created an API token, the token itself is displayed at the top. Please store it in a safe place. It is not possible to recover your token if you lose it.
