# Upgrade from LinkAce v1

Please follow these instructions to upgrade LinkAce to the new version 2.

## Preparation

Before upgrading, make sure to create a backup of your database and your `.env` file.

## Breaking changes

There are several breaking changes you should be aware of:

* The Docker image was renamed:
  * `linkace/linkace:simple` and `linkace/linkace:php-nginx` are now `linkace/linkace`
  * The advanced installation method with separate containers is no longer available
* Link visibility was changed:
  * The `private` and `public` options were replaced with a single `internal` option
  * All links will be migrated to the new visibility system automatically
* The backup feature was removed from LinkAce. Please use database backups instead.
* The `.env` variable `MAIL_DRIVER` was renamed to `MAIL_MAILER` to match Laravel defaults.
  * If you use `MAIL_DRIVER=smtp`, please change it to `MAIL_MAILER=smtp`

Please make sure to read the [v2 documentation](https://www.linkace.org/docs/v2/) for more information about the new features and changes.

## Select your current installation method

Please select the installation method you used for LinkAce v1:

* [Upgrade a simple Docker installation](#upgrade-a-simple-docker-installation)
* [Upgrade a manual Docker installation](#upgrade-a-manual-docker-installation)
* [Upgrade an advanced Docker installation](#upgrade-an-advanced-docker-installation)
* [Upgrade a non-Docker installation](#upgrade-a-non-docker-installation)

## Upgrade a simple Docker installation

LinkAce no longer has a dedicated "simple" image. Thus, the Docker image was renamed from `linkace/linkace:simple` or `linkace/linkace:php-nginx` to `linkace/linkace`.

### 1. Prepare your current installation

After taking a backup, stop your current containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 2. Adjust the docker-compose.yml file

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, rename the Docker image of LinkAce from `linkace/linkace:simple` or `linkace/linkace:php-nginx` to `linkace/linkace`. The port used inside the container stays at `80` and must not be changed.

You can take a look at the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/docker-compose.production.yml) and [.env](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/.env.docker.production) files directly and adopt it to your own setup if needed.

### 3. Running the data migration

After adjusting the docker-compose.yml file or your personal setup, restart your container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Now, run the database migrations and delete the current cache. The migration can take quite a while depending on your amount of links, lists and tags saved.

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
```

You may get a warning about running the migration in production mode. You should confirm the migration by answering with `yes`.

## Upgrade a manual Docker installation

As there was no specific guide for installing LinkAce v1 via `docker run` or any other non-Compose environment, we can't give general advice on upgrading your installation.

### 1. The Docker image was renamed

Whatever your Docker setup looks like, you have to rename your used LinkAce image from `linkace/linkace:simple` or `linkace/linkace:php-nginx` to `linkace/linkace`.

If you used `linkace/linkace` before, there is no longer an advanced installation method. LinkAce ships in a single Docker image containing a web server ready for production use. You likely have to change the deployment and adopt the new structure and used ports.

You can take a look at the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/docker-compose.production.yml) and [.env](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/.env.docker.production) files directly to check how LinkAce is now supposed to be used.

### 2. Running the data migration

After you upgraded your LinkAce Docker setup, the following commands must be run inside the LinkAce container:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan cache:clear
```

This could be done by running `docker run -it linkace php artisan migrate`, for example, but depends on your environment.

## Upgrade an advanced Docker installation

There is no longer an advanced installation method. LinkAce ships in a single Docker image containing a web server ready for production use.

### 1. Prepare your current installation

After taking a backup, stop your current containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 2. Adjust the docker-compose.yml file

Please download the Docker setup package and replace your existing `docker-compose.yml` file. Do NOT overwrite your .env file!

Alternatively, you can take a look at the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/docker-compose.production.yml) and [.env](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/blob/2.x/.env.docker.production) files directly and adopt it to your own setup.

### 3. Running the data migration

After adjusting the docker-compose.yml file or your personal setup, restart your container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Now, run the database migrations and delete the current cache. The migration can take quite a while depending on your amount of links, lists and tags saved.

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
```

You may get a warning about running the migration in production mode. You should confirm the migration by answering with `yes`.

## Upgrade a non-Docker installation

If you installed LinkAce without Docker, please follow the [update guide for non-Docker installations](https://www.linkace.org/docs/v2/upgrade/update-instructions/#upgrade-without-docker).

After the update, run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan cache:clear
```

You may get a warning about running the migration in production mode. You should confirm the migration by answering with `yes`.
